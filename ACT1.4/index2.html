            <p>Keyboard layouts have come a long way since the days of clunky typewriters. In today's digital age, where typing has become an integral part of our lives, the layout of keys on a keyboard plays a crucial role in our typing efficiency and comfort.
                This article delves deep into four distinctive keyboard layouts - QWERTY, Dvorak, Colemak, and AZERTY - to understand their origins, design principles, and the diverse user preferences that they cater to.

                        <h1>1.QWERTY</h1>
                        <h2> <em>The Standard Bearer</em></h2>
                        <p> - QWERTY is the omnipresent keyboard layout that most of us use daily. The name itself is derived from the arrangement of the first six letters in the top row of the keyboard. - Designed during the 19th century for typewriters,
                            QWERTY was meant to prevent key jams by separating frequently used letter combinations. - Despite its prevalence, it's worth noting that some typists argue that the QWERTY layout may not be the most efficient choice for modern
                            typing. The layout was designed for typewriters, where efficiency meant preventing jams, rather than optimizing for the fastest typing speeds. </p>

                        <h1>Dvorak</h1>
                        <h2> <em> A Scientific Approach </em></h2>
                        <p>- Dr. August Dvorak introduced the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard in the 1930s. His design aimed to revolutionize typing by enhancing both speed and accuracy. - Unlike QWERTY, Dvorak's layout was created with meticulous research into
                            the English language, placing the most commonly used letters and letter combinations in more accessible positions. - While the Dvorak layout is less popular than QWERTY, those who have made the switch often report increased
                            typing comfort and efficiency. It's a testament to the power of human-centered design and scientific optimization.</p>

                        <h1>Colemak</h1>
                        <h2> <em>A Modern Compromise</em></h2>
                        <p>- In 2006, Shai Coleman introduced Colemak, a more modern alternative to the standard QWERTY layout. - Colemak seeks to strike a balance between the familiarity of QWERTY and the efficiency of Dvorak. It retains many QWERTY key
                            positions while optimizing the placement of frequently used keys. - This compromise makes Colemak a popular choice among those who want to improve their typing efficiency without straying too far from the layout they are already
                            accustomed to.

                        <h1>AZERTY</h1>
                        <h2> <em>Meeting Linguistic Needs</em></h2>
                        <p>- The AZERTY layout is primarily used in French-speaking countries such as France and Belgium. - It closely resembles QWERTY but features key swaps to accommodate the unique requirements of the French language, including the inclusion
                            of accented characters. - Users in these regions often favor AZERTY for its language-specific advantages, as it streamlines the process of typing in French.</p>
