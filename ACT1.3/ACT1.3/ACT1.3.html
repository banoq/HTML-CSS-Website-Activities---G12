            <p class="animatedheader0">Keyboards come in a variety of sizes, each catering to different needs and preferences. From the compact and portable to the full-sized and ergonomic, the keyboard market offers a multitude of options. In this article, we'll explore the various
                keyboard sizes available and help you choose the perfect fit for your specific requirements.</p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="info1">1. Full-sized Keyboards</h3>
            <p><strong>Size:</strong> Standard layout with a width of approximately 17-18 inches and a depth of 6-8 inches.</p>
            <p>Full-sized keyboards are the most common and traditional type of keyboard. They feature the familiar layout with a full set of keys, including the alphanumeric keys, function row, navigation cluster, and a numeric keypad on the right side.
                These keyboards are excellent for general-purpose computing tasks, including typing documents, coding, and data entry.</p>

            <img src="Pictures/fullsizedkb.jpg" alt="Full-Sized Kevboard" width="500" height="600">

            <ul>
                <li>Familiar layout with all essential keys.</li>
                <li>Ideal for touch typists.</li>
                <li>Numeric keypad for efficient data input.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>

            <h3 class="info1">3. 60% Keyboards</h3>
            <p><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately 11-12 inches in width.</p>
            <p>60% keyboards are the ultimate in compactness. They retain only the essential alphanumeric keys, punctuation keys, and a few function keys. These keyboards are ideal for those who value portability and desk space savings above all else. They
                often require users to access additional functions through key combinations, making them a favorite among programmers and those who prioritize efficiency.</p>

            <img src="Pictures/60percent.png" alt="60percent Keyboard" width="500" height="600">

                <li>Not suitable for heavy data input or complex gaming.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h3 class="info1">4. Compact Keyboards</h3>
            <p><strong>Size:</strong> Between TKL and 60%, offering a balance between size and functionality.</p>
            <p>Compact keyboards aim to strike a balance between the portability of 60% keyboards and the functionality of TKL keyboards. They retain most essential keys while omitting the numeric keypad and some function keys. Compact keyboards are a versatile
                choice for users who want a smaller footprint without sacrificing too much functionality.</p>

            <img src="Pictures/compactkb.jpg" alt="Compact Keyboard" width="500" height="600">

                <li>Some key combinations may be needed for less common functions.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h3 class="info1">5. Ergonomic Keyboards</h3>
            <p><strong>Size:</strong> Varies, but often larger than standard keyboards due to unique ergonomic shapes.</p>
            <p>Ergonomic keyboards come in various shapes and sizes, designed to reduce strain and discomfort during extended typing sessions. They may have split designs, contoured key layouts, or adjustable angles to promote a more natural typing posture.
                These keyboards are ideal for individuals with repetitive strain injuries or those who prioritize ergonomic health.</p>

            <img src="Pictures/ergonomickb.png" alt="Ergonomic Keyboard" width="500" height="600">

            <br>

    <h2>Are keyboard Switches different?</h2>
    <p> Keyboards are something we use all the time, whether it's for work, gaming, or just everyday tasks on our computers. But have you ever thought about what's underneath those keys? Well, it turns out that the type of switch under each key can make a
        big difference in how our keyboards feel and perform. Choosing the right switch is crucial because it affects how comfortable and efficient our typing experience is. There are different types of switches, each with its own unique qualities, and
        they cater to various preferences and needs. Some switches are all about that satisfying clicky feel when you press a key, which can be great for typing. Others are designed to be super quiet, which is handy if you're in a noise-sensitive environment.
        And if you're into gaming, there are switches that provide lightning-fast response times. So, picking the right keyboard switch isn't just about personal preference; it can actually enhance your overall computer use and make your keyboard feel
        just right for you.

        <h2>Mechanical Switches</h2>
        <p>
            Mechanical switches are known for their tactile feedback and audible click sound. They are popular among gamers and typists who prefer a precise and tactile typing experience. Some people prefer this because when you press them, you can feel a little
            bump, and they make a satisfying click sound. People who love playing games and those who type a lot really like these switches because they make typing feel precise and enjoyable. So, if you want your typing and gaming to feel extra nice,
            mechanical switches are the way to go!

        <h2>Membrane Switches</h2>
        <p>
            Membrane switches are a popular choice due to their cost-effectiveness and versatility, finding extensive application in a wide range of keyboards. These switches operate by utilizing rubber domes to detect and record key presses. This design not only
            makes them affordable but also contributes to a quieter typing experience when compared to the more audible keystrokes produced by mechanical switches. This combination of affordability and quiet performance has made membrane switches a preferred
            option for many keyboard users.

        <h2>Scissor Switches</h2>

        <img src="Pictures/scissorswitchmac.png" alt="Scissor Switch" width="400">

        <p>
            Scissor switches are a type of keyboard mechanism commonly found in slim laptops and sleek low-profile keyboards. They're known for their user-friendly design and are favored in portable devices. These switches are designed to provide a comfortable typing
            experience while keeping devices thin and compact. When you press a key with a scissor switch, two plastic pieces resembling a pair of scissors come together, creating a smooth keystroke. One of the great things about scissor switches is that
            they offer a shallow keypress. This means you don't have to press the keys very far, making typing quicker and reducing finger fatigue during long typing sessions. The shallow design also contributes to the slimness of laptops and keyboards.
            Thanks to their space-saving design, scissor switches play a crucial role in making laptops and keyboards thinner without sacrificing usability. So, the next time you type on a slim laptop or low-profile keyboard, you can appreciate the scissor
            switches that make it all possible.
